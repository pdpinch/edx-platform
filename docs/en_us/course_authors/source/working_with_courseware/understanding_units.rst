.. _What is a Unit?:

****************************
What is a Unit?
****************************

A unit is a part of a subsection. A subsection contains one or more units. Subsections are divided into units. A unit, in turn, contains one or more components, such as HTML content, problems, discussions, and videos.

Viewing Units as a Student

To a student using the edX Learning Management System, each unit in the subsection appears as a link on the course ribbon at the top of the page. The following image shows a subsection that has eight units:

Unit States
************************************************

As an course author, you work with units in the following states:

========================
Draft (Never Published)
========================

When you create a new unit and add components to it, the unit is in the state **Draft (Never Published)**, as shown in the right panel:

IMAGE

The unit does not appear in the ribbon for the subsection in the LMS. Students do not see a Draft (Never Published) unit. Though you do not see the unit in the LMS, you can preview the unit LINK.

You must publish the unit (ADD LINK) for it to be included in the LMS.

When you publish a unit, the unit is in the state **Published**, as shown in the right panel:

The unit may or may not be visible to students, depending on the release date and whether or not you chose to hide the unit from students. For more information, see LINK


===========================
Draft (Unpublished Changes)
===========================

When you edit a published unit, its state changes to **Draft (Unpublished Changes)**, as shown in the right panel:

The unit as shown in the LMS does not contain your changes until you publish them; the LMS shows the last published version of the unit.
